=: Description: A website I created as the technical challenge for the Web Development Team for The Daily Pennsylvanian, a student-run newspaper at the University of Pennsylvania.
This website displays the live titles, authors, number of views, and images for the top 10 recently most-read DP articles through a user-friendly aesthetic.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website, and I used jQuery to access the endpoint for the top 10 most-read DP articles.
